## Vanilla JS Todo List App

This is a simple todo list app written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It is built using Vite. The basis for this project is the Todo list tutorial on W3Schools. The app has some more styling and uses the Local Storage API to store the todo items and render them to the page when a refresh happens.

This App is deployed to gh-pages (https://bernhard759.github.io/Vite-VanillaJS-App_Todo_list/).
